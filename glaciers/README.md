The glaciers and snow-capped peaks of the [Chugach National Forest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chugach_National_Forest) in southern Alaska. Visible are the massive [Columbia](http://ak.water.usgs.gov/glaciology/columbia/) [Harvard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Glacier), and [Yale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Glacier) Glaciers (from west to east in frame).
