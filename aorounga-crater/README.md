# Aorounga Crater

The [Aorounga crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorounga_crater) in northern Chad was formed by a meteorite impact over 300 million years ago. South of the [Tibesti Mountain Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibesti_Mountains), the crater is 12 km across. This image was taken by Japan's ALOS platform in late 2013.
